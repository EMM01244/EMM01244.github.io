   <h1>Guinea pigs: The right pet for you?</h1>
   <p>Guinea pigs have a lot of appealing qualities: They're small, gentle and personable, just to name a few. Like all companion animals though, they require special care and attention. Here are some important questions to consider before adopting a guinea pig:</p>
   <h2>Where should you get a guinea pig?</h2>
   <p>Instead of creating more demand for guinea pigs by purchasing one from a pet store, please visit your local animal shelter to adopt one—or better yet, two! Most shelters accept small animals who need new homes and you will have the satisfaction of saving a life.</p>
   <h2>How much time do you have?</h2>
   <p>Guinea pigs need time out of their cage every day. Whether this time is spent stretching their legs and exploring new environments or cuddling in your lap, daily interaction and attention are essential for a guinea pig's well-being. Guinea pigs need to be groomed regularly. Shorthaired breeds can be maintained with a once-a-week brushing while longhaired breeds require daily grooming. A guinea pig's cage should be thoroughly cleaned on a weekly basis and spot-cleaned every few days. If you don't enjoy the smell of a dirty cage, consider how your guinea pig—who spends nearly all of their waking hours just inches above their bedding—feels about stinky living quarters.
   </p>
   <h2>Is a guinea pig right for your family?</h2>
   <p>If you're getting a guinea pig for your child, consider how this animal’s care will fit into your family's schedule over the long haul.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>	Can your son or daughter incorporate pet ownership into a busy after-school schedule and evening and weekend commitments?</li>
     <li>	Are you willing to shoulder responsibility for your pig's care if your children drop the ball?</li>
     <li>	If you have other pets, how will you ensure your guinea pig will get enough attention?</li>
   </ul>
    <p>Young children often lack fine motor control and self-restraint, which means they may inadvertently drop a guinea pig, squeeze them or scare them into biting. Guinea pigs require a gentle touch and may be easily startled by sudden movement and loud noises.</p>
